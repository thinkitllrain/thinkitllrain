<p>the government should avoid dabbling in art. art is of the people</p>
<p>our mayor thought it necessary to import it</p>
<p>perhaps then this is of mayoral inspiration, but i think its coincidence</p>

<p>here is my contribution to the artistic landscape of your mind and our community</p>
<p>its a house that i could live in, but i am presumably not permitted to, it is therefore, an art project</p>
<p>i have spoken with the rain, and this project has been approved</p>
<p>i should like to think that if my art were a pencil, it would have a very sharp point</p>
<p>the website for this project can be found at <a href=""></a></p>
<p>every aspect of this project is made with a zero budget and it will remain that way</p>
<p>its is proof that creation does not require money</p>
<p>it is presented to you with respect</p>
